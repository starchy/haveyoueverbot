Have-you-ever Bot! (Based on Metaphor-a-Minute)
==========

Requires [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/). You also need a Twitter App access token, consumer key, and associated secrets: https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new

Finally, you need a Wordnik API key, which you can apply for here: http://developer.wordnik.com/

(You'll need to add all that info to metaphor.js before running the program, otherwise Wordnik and Twitter won't play nice. Don't worry, it's all commented.)

> npm install node-restclient@0.0.1

> npm install twit@1.1.6

> node metaphor.js
